This repo is currently in beta and under development. We expect frequent, unannounced, breaking changes to occur. In particular,
the generated code should be considered unstable. We suggest that you use the wrappers provided in the `aptible` package instead because
those expose a more stable interface.

This library has been experimentally used in production, primarily through the Aptible Terraform provider, without significant issues for the
past few months. We would still suggest caution because that has only exercised a subset of the functionality and critical bugs may not have
been discovered in other portions.
